# linksRedirector
A project that uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB, Mongoose. At this project I use it to study this mentioneded technologies.
His functionality resumes into a interface where the user can add a parameter (title), with a link and description where this parameter will be added at the URL, (Example: localhost:3000/title), and this parameter will redirect to the URL that the user add when sing up the Title.
